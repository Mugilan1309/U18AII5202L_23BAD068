# Experiment 4: Traffic Accident Analysis

## Description
This experiment analyzes traffic accident data to understand the relationship between accident severity, frequency, and location. It visualizes these multi-dimensional attributes using bubble charts to identify high-risk areas.

## Files Included
*   `code/ex4.R`: R script for data summarization and visualization.
*   `data/4.traffic_accidents.csv`: Dataset containing accident details like Location, Type, and Severity.
*   `figures/`: Directory for output visualizations.

## Visualization Outputs
1.  **Accident Severity and Frequency (Bubble Chart):**
    *   **Objective:** To visualize the frequency and severity of accidents across different locations.
    *   **Insight:** Highlights correlations between location types and accident severity, with bubble size representing frequency.

## Dependencies
*   `ggplot2`
*   `dplyr`
*   `RColorBrewer`
