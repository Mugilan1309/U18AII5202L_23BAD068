# Experiment 3: Multivariate Analysis

## Description
This experiment compares multivariate data across different groups to identify correlations and patterns between health indicators. It utilizes pair plots to visualize relationships between multiple variables simultaneously.

## Files Included
* `code/ex3.R`: R script for generating the multivariate analysis.
* `data/3.healthcare_data.csv`: Dataset containing health metrics including Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, and Glucose Level.
* `figures/`: Directory for output visualizations.

## Visualization Outputs
1.  **Multivariate Analysis (Pair Plot):**
    *   **Objective:** To analyze correlations between Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, and Glucose Level across different age groups (Young, Middle-Aged, Senior).
    *   **Insight:** Visualizes the pairwise relationships and distributions of health metrics, highlighting how different age groups cluster.

## Dependencies
*   `ggplot2`
*   `GGally`
